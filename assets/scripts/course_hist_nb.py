I'm making content for a personal website that will include details on my
activities and course histories. This page will serve as a sort of 'Appendix'
for my CV, with added detail should an interested person check it out.

General Task: Convert HTML table to DataFrame; make new HTML Table with
Required Information
We want to take the raw table data (saved manually from a password protected
student portal by inspecting elements with Chrome).
We will strip away extraneous information, and make a simple list of the
institution's course name and number with a brief description or name,
correcting missing or poorly formatted data with correct or better details.
What follows are the steps taken along with some justification.
If you have any comments, please make them on the github repository
as an issue.

Thanks a bunch!
