<p>This has been one hell of a journey. Below you will find a synopsis of my activities at the moment (See: Courses and Reading) and over the last few years (Concordia).
  <p>At present, it is sparse as my foray into this world of Computer Science, Data Analysis, and Algorithms is as young and frisky as a kitten. While learning to make my living, it's a challenge to align the kinds of ideas I can come up with to
    present with my actual skill. So...
    <p>As time progresses, and I become more comfortable, I will update this space with personal projects. Working in conjunction with a research librarian, Matthew Fells, the goal is to present original analysis along side discussions on topics such
      as:
      <ul>
        <li>Economics</li>
        <li>Earth and Planetary Sciences</li>
        <li>Exoplanet-related Machine Learning</li>
        <li>Rebuttals of Claims</li>
        <li>Discussions on Reproducibility in the Sciences</li>
        <li>and more...</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I invite you to keep an eye out here for details. In the meanwhile, have a look below at my current activities, and past accomplishments. Peace! I'm out... for now!
