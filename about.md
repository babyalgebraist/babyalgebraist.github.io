<h1>The Journey <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span> the Destination</h1>

<p>This has been one hell of a journey to get to this beautiful place I'm in now. And I'm not settling here. I'm something of a "Knowledge Knowmad" (I am sooooo sorry. I just cannot help myself...)</p>
<p>I went back to school to prove to myself that it wasn't a fluke the first time. But also because having risen to one of the many peaks that dot the landscape of Hospitality (see <a href="/history">History > Education</a>).</p>

<p>At <a href="/history">History</a> you will find an overview of my formal education with the most recent courses and descriptions.  Also, there is a section full of what's keeping me busy while I <a href="/history">close the gap on my CS and programming/design knowledge</a></p>

<p>As things progress, and I become more comfortable, I will update this space with personal projects. Working in conjunction with a research librarian, Matthew Fells, the goal is to present original analysis along side discussions on topics such as: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Economics</li>
    <li>Earth and Planetary Sciences</li>
    <li>Astronomy-related Machine Learning</li>
    <li>Rebuttals of Claims</li>
    <li>Discussions on Reproducibility in the Sciences</li>
    <li>and more...</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I invite you to peruse, raise issues, and collaborate with me, suggesting topics as 'feature requests' or becoming involved building tools. In the meanwhile, get to know me a bit, and see what I'm about.</p>

  <p>Be kind to eachother, be kind to yourself, and Peace! </p>
