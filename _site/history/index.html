    <p> Never one to be idle, here is a list of what I've been up to while I 'skill up' on the road to changing careers.</p>
    <p>
      With the formal education out of the way, here is a list of the online courses I've been working on since graduation, followed by some of the languages I am noodling around with in these courses. (I know, I know: "Where's the proof!?" It's coming. Soon.  Had to make the website first.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond that, what I'm currently using as reference and 'light' reading.  I hope to put up some reviews at which time those will be linked here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, I list a couple of the big things that have happened to me, which might show I'm human. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
      If you notice any typos, please let me know! jf

            <p>
              After a decade-long hiatus, I returned to university to complete my mathematics degree.  In addition to some mathematics classes, I enjoyed studying Geology as it connects with my long and abiding interest in the nature of the universe and the stuff in it.  Macroscopic looks at the structures and components of the world we live in also tells us about our Solar System, and the worlds and stars beyond it.

                        Ce cours s’adresse à des étudiantes et des étudiants non francophones qui souhaitent améliorer les aptitudes nécessaires à une communication orale efficace en français. Des présentations théoriques et des activités pratiques exploitant des situations de communication variées leur permettront d’acquérir une plus grande aisance et de mieux organiser leur discours. Des activités d’écoute basées sur des documents authentiques leur permettront d’augmenter leur capacité de compréhension en français.

                        This course provides an overview of the physical processes that govern how the Earth works. Topics include origin of the solar system and Earth; analysis of the internal structure of the Earth; minerals and rocks; igneous and metamorphic processes; deformation of the crust; surficial processes, including weathering, deposition and glaciation. The course culminates with the integration of these geological processes in the theory of plate tectonics, and goes on to examine the interactions of crust, mantle, atmosphere, and biosphere from this perspective.

                After an exposure to Arthur Koestler's <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sleepwalkers_(Koestler_book)">The Sleepwalkers</a></cite> in a History of Science class, I made the decision to change programs and take a deep dive into the process that is the Scientific Method.  In this work, I compared the ways in which popular culture views knowledge: "discovered" versus "revealed". In other words: scientific research versus religious scholarship. I compared them through the lens of "human salvation".

                      <q>
                      The course covers basic algorithmic techniques and ideas for computational problems arising frequently in practical applications: sorting and searching, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming. We will learn a lot of theory: how to sort data and how it helps for searching; how to break a large problem into pieces and solve them recursively; when it makes sense to proceed greedily; how dynamic programming is used in genomic studies. You will practice solving computational problems, designing new algorithms, and implementing solutions efficiently[.]

                        A good algorithm usually comes together with a set of good data structures that allow the algorithm to manipulate the data efficiently. In this course, we consider the common data structures that are used in various computational problems. You will learn how these data structures are implemented in different programming languages and will practice implementing them in our programming assignments. This will help you to understand what is going on inside a particular built-in implementation of a data structure and what to expect from it. You will also learn typical use cases for these data structures.

                        In this course, you will first learn what a graph is and what are some of the most important properties. Then you'll learn several ways to traverse graphs and how you can do useful things while traversing the graph in some order. We will then talk about shortest paths algorithms — from the basic ones to those which open door for 1000000 times faster algorithms used in Google Maps and other navigational services. You will use these algorithms if you choose to work on our Fast Shortest Routes industrial capstone project. We will finish with minimum spanning trees which are used to plan road, telephone and computer networks and also find applications in clustering and approximate algorithms.

All those are strings from the point of view of computer science. To make sense of all that information and make search efficient, search engines use many string algorithms. Moreover, the emerging field of personalized medicine uses many search algorithms to find disease-causing mutations in the human genome.

                        You've learned the basic algorithms now and are ready to step into the area of more complex problems and algorithms to solve them. Advanced algorithms build upon basic ones and use new ideas. We will start with networks flows which are used in more typical applications such as optimal matchings, finding disjoint paths and flight scheduling as well as more surprising ones like image segmentation in computer vision. We then proceed to linear programming with applications in optimizing budget allocation, portfolio optimization, finding the cheapest diet satisfying all requirements and many others. Next we discuss inherently hard problems for which no exact good solutions are known (and not likely to be found) and how to solve them in practice. We finish with a soft introduction to streaming algorithms that are heavily used in Big Data processing. Such algorithms are usually designed to be able to process huge datasets without being able even to store a dataset.

                      <q>
                        In Spring 2011, thousands of people in Germany were hospitalized with a deadly disease that started as food poisoning with bloody diarrhea and often led to kidney failure. It was the beginning of the deadliest outbreak in recent history, caused by a mysterious bacterial strain that we will refer to as E. coli X. Soon, German officials linked the outbreak to a restaurant in Lübeck, where nearly 20% of the patrons had developed bloody diarrhea in a single week. At this point, biologists knew that they were facing a previously unknown pathogen and that traditional methods would not suffice – computational biologists would be needed to assemble and analyze the genome of the newly emerged pathogen. To investigate the evolutionary origin and pathogenic potential of the outbreak strain, researchers started a crowdsourced research program. They released bacterial DNA sequencing data from one of a patient, which elicited a burst of analyses carried out by computational biologists on four continents. They even used <a href="https://github.com/ehec-outbreak-crowdsourced/BGI-data-analysis/wiki">[GitHub for the project]</a>  The 2011 German outbreak represented an early example of epidemiologists collaborating with computational biologists to stop an outbreak. In this Genome Assembly Programming Challenge, you will follow in the footsteps of the bioinformaticians investigating the outbreak by developing a program to assemble the genome of the E. coli X from millions of overlapping substrings of the E.coli X genome.

          In 2014, my family and I spent more than 6 months in Cape Town, South Africa, one of the most beautiful cities in the world.  While there, I got deeply involved in the ocean sailing community there, participating in races, working the safety boat, and accumulating miles for my logbook.  At the time, I was hoping to get a professional certification so that I could work as crew and even deliver yachts on my own.  A nice side gig no

              <p>
                Since my first review in 1999, every meal I’ve enjoyed at Moishes has been better than the last. Yet I always held to the line that a steak house could never rate more than three stars for one reason: lack of innovation. But after many years I’ve come to the conclusion that though innovation and artistry always merit praise, shouldn’t the mastery of simplicity be commended as well?
